# Weather Activity - React-Rails Application

This application allows the user to fetch current weather for a zipcode from the OpenWeatherMap API up to every 30 minutes. Data is stored in the Rails backend API.  The primary functionality of the app is to provide the user with a suggestion for an activity based on that weather. Logged in users can maintain the master activity list by adding, updating and removing activities.

## Demo Link

A demo video of the application can be found [here](https://youtu.be/S7pG2qoc0Ng).

## Installation

Clone down this repository and the sister repository [here](https://github.com/BrownCow371/weather-app-client-react). Run bundle, rake db:migrate and rake db:seed from your terminal for the rails directory. Also run npm install from the terminal in the react directory. Then, from the rails directory, in the terminal call 'rake start' to launch both servers. The application will be running on your localhost:3000 port and the API will be running on localhost:3001. 

In order for the weather portion of the application to work, you will need to either get your own API key from the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/appid) and put it in an .env file at the root of the rails API repository with an APPID=YOURKEY (make sure there are no spaces or new lines after the key). Or you can use the sample data from the API by opening the searches_controller file in the Rails API repository and uncommenting the sample fetch in the call_weather_api method and commenting out the live api call code noted there. Note that the sample data is provided in degrees Kelvin.
